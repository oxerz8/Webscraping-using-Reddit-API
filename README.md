# Webscraping-using-Reddit-API
## Writing script to scrape data from reddit
* Receiving authentication from the reddit API 
* Obtaining top posts from any subreddit
* Retrieved all attributes of the post 
* Converted the data into a Pandas Dataframe
* Wanted to add: Explore the data from the different subreddits and find possible correlations between the words used in the topics of top posts and the reactions garnered by them in the form of likes, dislikes and comments (Sentimental Analysis).
